# ProtonVM: Parallel Bytecode Interpreter For Heterogeneous Hardware 

In a nutshell, ProtoVM is a tiny Parallel Java Bytecode Interpreter (BC) implemented in OpenCL capable of executing on heterogeneous architectures (multi-core CPUs, GPUs and FPGAs).

ProtonVM is a proof-of-concept for running a subset of the Java bytecodes in C++ and OpenCL. The bytecodes defined correspond to an extension of the small-subset 
of Java bytecode explained by Terence Parr, from the University of San Francisco of how to [build a simple Virtual Machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjaAToVkoTw). 
This project extends this simple bytecode interpreter to study the feasibility of  running, as efficiently as possible, parallel bytecode interpreters on
heterogeneous computer architectures.

ProtonVM currently runs integer arithmetic only. A possible extension is to include `fp32` and `fp64` math arithmetic and support complex math operations. This way ProtonVM could take 
advantage of the compute-power of modern GPUs, and DSPs available on FPGAs. 

ProtonVM has been presented at [MoreVMs 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mok6crMdKgI) and it has been executed on NVIDIA GPUs, Intel HD Graphics and Xilinx FPGAs.

#define PARALLEL_GLOAD_INDEXED 27    // load data by accessing device's heap using the thread-id (multi-heap configuration)

```

### Versions of the BC Interpreter

ProtonVM provides different variations of the BC interpreter for testing and experimentation:

* `VM`: this is the baseline BC interpreter implemented in C++. It runs sequentially on the CPU.
* `OCLVM`: Single-thread OpenCL BC interpreter. It is prepared for running a single device thread on the target device. The stack, data and code sections are stored on device's global memory.
* `OCLVMPrivate`:  Single-thread OpenCL BC interpreter. It is prepared for running a single device thread on the target device. The stack is stored in private memory, and data and code sections are stored on device's global memory.
* `OCLVMParallelLoop`: This version of the interpreter is prepared for running with a multi-thread bytecode interpreter exploiting data parallelization. Each thread has its own stack and it performs exactly the same computation across device's threads. The OpenCL kernel is programmed to do the work per thread. Furthermore, this version uses a multi-heap (3 in this case), that allows accessing data in parallel. There are two heaps dedicated to read-only and one for write-only. The stack is stored in private memory, and the heaps are accessed using local memory.


### Example

```cpp
void runParallelOpenCLInterpreter() {
    int size = 1024;
    int groupSize = 16;

    // List of instructions 
    vector<int> vectorMul = {
        THREAD_ID,                  // Push OpenCL Thread-ID into the stack
        DUP,                        // Duplicate the Thread-ID on top of the stack
        PARALLEL_GLOAD_INDEXED, 0,  // Access global memory (e.g., GPU's global memory) using the thread-id and heap index 0
                                    // and push the result (value) on top of the stack
        THREAD_ID,                  // Push OpenCL Thread-ID on top of the stack
        PARALLEL_GLOAD_INDEXED, 1,  // Access global memory (e.g., GPU's global memory) using the thread-id and heap index 1
                                    // and push the result (value) on top of the stack      
        IMUL,                       // Multiply the two elements on top of the stack and push the result
        PARALLEL_GSTORE_INDEXED, 2, // Store the value on top of the stack into global memory (heap 2).
        HALT                        // Stop the program (stack must be empty)
    };

    OCLVMParallelLoop oclVM(vectorMul, 0);     // Create a parallel BC Interpreter and VM
    oclVM.setVMConfig(100, 1024);              // Set sizes for the stack and data sections
    oclVM.setHeapSizes(1024);                  // Set a heap of 1024 int values
    oclVM.setPlatform(0);                      // Select the OpenCL platform 0 for execution
    oclVM.initOpenCL("src/interpreterParallelLoop.cl", false); // Compile the OpenCL BC Interpreter. The second parameter is for FPGA execution. 
    oclVM.initHeap();                          // Init values on the heap
    oclVM.runInterpreter(1024, groupSize);     // Execute the BC interpreter using 1024 threads and groupsize of 16 threads. 
}
